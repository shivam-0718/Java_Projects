## 📂 Project Structure

This repository is primarily dedicated to **Java development projects**, with a strong focus on hands-on learning and implementation of key technologies such as **JDBC**, **Hibernate**, **Servlets**, **JSP**, **Spring Boot**, **Spring MVC**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring AI**, and **Microservices**.  
The aim is to build a comprehensive set of Java-based applications that represent real-world scenarios and enterprise development practices.

All Java-related projects are organized within the `Java/` directory.
