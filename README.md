## 📂 Project Structure

This repository is dedicated to **Java development projects**, focusing on practical, hands-on learning with foundational technologies such as **JDBC**, **Hibernate**, **Servlets**, and **JSP**.

> ⚙️ I'm currently learning and building projects using these core Java technologies to solidify my understanding before moving on to advanced frameworks like **Spring Boot**, **Spring MVC**, and **Spring Data JPA**.

All Java-related implementations are organized under the `Java/` directory.
